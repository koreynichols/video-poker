<p>One of my favorite games when I was a kid was playing a handheld video poker game. I used that as inspiration for this project. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.</p>

<p>Use the right arrow button to increase bet and left arrow to decrease. The highlighted column is what you can win with your current bet.</p>
Click the deal button to deal your hand. Click on any cards you want to hold. Cards you select to hold will have a red border like the queens in the image below.

Once you've finished selecting the cards you want to hold, click the draw button. This will replace the cards you dont hold with new cards. If you win, the win amount will be highlighted in green and you winnings will be added to your credits.

Features I will be adding soon:
- Prevent user from going into negative credits
- Button to reset credits to 100
- If user loses all credits, display prompt to reset game
